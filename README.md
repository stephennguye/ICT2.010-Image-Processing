# ICT2.010 Image Processing

This repository contains my labwork and submissions for the **ICT2.010 Image Processing** course at the University of Science and Technology Hanoi (USTH), where I learned fundamental concepts and techniques in digital image processing, implemented using **Python**. The work demonstrates my understanding of image analysis, enhancement, and transformation methods.

## ðŸ“˜ Course Overview
The Image Processing course focused on:
- Understanding how images are represented and manipulated in a digital format.
- Applying image enhancement, filtering, and transformation techniques.
- Implementing algorithms for image analysis and computer vision applications.

## ðŸ§  Key Topics Learned
Throughout the course, I explored and practiced:
1. **Image Representation & Fundamentals**  
   - Pixels, color models (Grayscale), histograms.
2. **Image Enhancement**  
   - Contrast adjustment, histogram equalization, noise reduction.
3. **Filtering & Convolution**  
   - Smoothing, sharpening, and edge detection filters.
4. **Geometric Transformations**  
   - Scaling, rotation, translation, affine transformations.
5. **Morphological Operations**  
   - Erosion, dilation, opening, and closing (binary and grayscale images).
6. **Segmentation Techniques**  
   - Thresholding, region growing, and clustering.
7. **Frequency Domain Processing** *(if included)*  
   - Fourier transforms and filtering in frequency space.
